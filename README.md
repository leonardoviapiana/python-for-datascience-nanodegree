## Leonardo Viapiana - Python Project Introduction

In this repository you'll find the code I wrote in Python (version 3.7.1) to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States — Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

### Workflow 

I imported the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics. It's possible to filter the results by geography (city) and time (month/weekday)

### Dataset 

The data I queried to obtain the results, are contained in the following files:

    • chicago.csv
    • new_york_city.csv
    • washington.csv

It's possible to download files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sehxHZlDqTSOazkEgXH1Tx4IsI2flEyL?usp=sharing)

### Project Submission

The final step of the project was about refactoring the previous submission on GitHub using Git.
