# Programming for Data Science with Python

## Introduction

In this repository you'll find the code I wrote in Python (version 3.7.1) to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States — Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

### Goal of the Project

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 

### Workflow 

I imported the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics. It's possible to filter the results by geography (city) and time (month/weekday).

### Dataset 

The data I queried to obtain the results, are contained in the following files:

    • chicago.csv
    • new_york_city.csv
    • washington.csv

### Project Submission

The final step of the project was about refactoring the previous submission on GitHub using Git.
